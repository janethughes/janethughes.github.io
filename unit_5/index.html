					<li><h4>Digital leadership</h4> I write on <a href="https://medium.com/@JanetHughes">Medium</a> for <a href="https://doteveryone.org.uk">Doteveryone</a> about effective leadership in a digital age and <a href="https://medium.com/doteveryone/what-a-digital-organisation-looks-like-82426a210ab8">what it means to be a digital organisation</a></li> 	
					<li><h4>Delivery</h4> I believe in working in the open, so I usually (with clients' permission) like to write about the work I'm doing with organisations, for example on <a href="http://transformation.blog.nhs.uk/our-first-team-unconference">NHS Digital's first unconference</a>, or <a href="https://identityassurance.blog.gov.uk/2016/03/11/goals-cycles-and-people-running-an-agile-complex-programme-in-government/">how goals, cycles and people interact</a> at the Government Digital Service</li>
					<li><h4>Digital government</h4> I write and take part in panel debates about government in a digital age - see for example my <a href="#">article on boldness in the civil service</a>, and appearing on a <a href="#">panel at the Institute for Government</a></li>
